This is the code for the Capstone project Companion Bot, completed in the Fall 2023 semester by Michael Harding, Dylan Binu, Jakob Massaro, Collin Radecke, and Andy Yoon.

A completed and working companion bot is in Collin's possession.

This companion bot utilizes google translate API, amazon transcribe API, Open Weather API, aws rekognize API, as well as ChatGPT API in conglamoration with a variety of hardware to provide the user with a personalized experience of verbal communication with artificial inteligence.

I will also try to include the files necessary for the design of the body if possible.

Thank you for your interest.
